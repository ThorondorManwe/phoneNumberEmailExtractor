This project is solved by the author, Al Sweigart in his book 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python', I'm just uploading this to practice with GIT and Github
The code will need to do the following:

Use the pyperclip module to copy and paste strings.
Create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and the other for matching email addresses.
Find all matches, not just the first match, of both regexes.
Neatly format the matched strings into a single string to paste.
Display some kind of message if no matches were found in the text.
